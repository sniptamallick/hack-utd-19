# Food For Thought
## Purpose
In the United States alone, food waste amounts to $680 billion dollars lost every year, with 40% of food waste coming from consumer use. However, nearly 40 million Americans and more than 12 million children are food insecure. Moreover, up to 50% of college students experience food insecurity on a daily basis, many opting to eat cheap fast-food or ramen. 

There is a large disparity between the food secure and insecure in the United States, and we are here to close that gap. Food For Thought is a mobile app that seeks to connect UTD students to local food banks and campus food centers, while generating healthy recipes from their food choices.
